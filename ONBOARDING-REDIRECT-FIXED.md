# 🔄 Onboarding Redirect Fixed

## ❌ **Issue Fixed:**

- **Problem**: New users were landing on homepage instead of starting onboarding
- **Impact**: Users without accounts could access the app without going through setup
- **User Experience**: Confusing flow for first-time users

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

- **Added redirect logic** to main page (`/`)
- **Checks for `userId`** in localStorage
- **Redirects to `/welcome`** if no user found
- **Maintains existing flow** for returning users

## 🔄 **New User Flow:**

```
New User → Homepage → Redirect to Welcome → Onboarding (5 steps) → Homepage
```

## 📱 **What Happens Now:**

### **First-Time Users:**

1. **Visit app** → lands on homepage
2. **No userId found** → automatically redirects to `/welcome`
3. **Complete onboarding** → 5 steps (welcome, nickname, meditations, length, notifications)
4. **Finish onboarding** → redirected to homepage with full access

### **Returning Users:**

1. **Visit app** → lands on homepage
2. **userId found** → stays on homepage
3. **Normal app experience** → partnerships, meditation tracking, etc.

## 📦 **Updated Deployment:**

- **Folder**: `serenity-pwa-netlify/` (1.7MB)
- **Status**: ✅ **Fixed and ready for deployment**
- **Redirect Logic**: Automatically sends new users to onboarding
- **User Experience**: Seamless onboarding flow

## 🚀 **Deploy Instructions:**

1. **Go to**: [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
2. **Drag and drop** the updated `serenity-pwa-netlify` folder
3. **Wait for deployment** (1-2 minutes)
4. **Test new user flow** - should redirect to welcome page

## 🧪 **Testing:**

- **Clear localStorage** (simulate new user)
- **Visit app** → should redirect to welcome page
- **Complete onboarding** → should end up on homepage
- **Return to app** → should stay on homepage (returning user)

**The onboarding redirect has been fixed and new users will now start with the welcome page!** 🎉
